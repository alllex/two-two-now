Shows a **Two Two ID** for the current time.

The Two Two ID (TT for short) are compact, time-based identifiers representing the number of seconds until 2100-01-01T00:00:00Z, encoded in Base58.

They look like this: `tt4bJBfj` - always prefixed with `tt` plus 6 characters to encode the time.

The name comes from the onset of the 22 century that these IDs signify.

Why?

- Compact, URL-safe and human-friendly
